feat: Enhance project documentation and file structure

This commit introduces significant improvements to the project's documentation and file structure representation.

- **Updated `file.md`:** The `file.md` has been corrected to accurately reflect the working directory of the project, excluding ignored files and directories like `.idea` and `.venv`. This provides a cleaner and more accurate representation of the project's structure.

- **Comprehensive `README.md`:** A new, detailed `README.md` has been created from scratch. It now includes:
    - A clear and concise project description.
    - A comprehensive list of features.
    - Detailed setup and installation instructions.
    - A complete list of all available slash commands, categorized for clarity.
    - Links to the official support and testing Discord servers.
